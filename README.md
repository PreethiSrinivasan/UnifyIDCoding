1. Using the HTTP API for random.org (https://www.random.org/clients/http/) we will ask you to get truly random numbers. Look out for the guidelines, or you may get banned!

2. Using these random numbers create one of the following, to get bonus points:

- An RGB bitmap picture of 128x128 pixels. (70 points)

- A white noise WAV sound sample of 3 seconds (70 points)

- An RSA key pair (We would discourage you from implementing your own textbook keypair implementation based on exponents and GCD, 100 points)
